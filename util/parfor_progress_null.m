function percent = parfor_progress(N)
%PARFOR_PROGRESS Progress monitor (progress bar) that works with parfor.
%   PARFOR_PROGRESS works by creating a file called parfor_progress.txt in
%   your working directory, and then keeping track of the parfor loop's
%   progress within that file. This workaround is necessary because parfor
%   workers cannot communicate with one another so there is no simple way
%   to know which iterations have finished and which haven't.
%
%   PARFOR_PROGRESS(N) initializes the progress monitor for a set of N
%   upcoming calculations.
%
%   PARFOR_PROGRESS updates the progress inside your parfor loop and
%   displays an updated progress bar.
%
%   PARFOR_PROGRESS(0) deletes parfor_progress.txt and finalizes progress
%   bar.
%
%   To suppress output from any of these functions, just ask for a return
%   variable from the function calls, like PERCENT = PARFOR_PROGRESS which
%   returns the percentage of completion.
%
%   Example:
%
%      N = 100;
%      parfor_progress(N);
%      parfor i=1:N
%         pause(rand); % Replace with real code
%         parfor_progress;
%      end
%      parfor_progress(0);
